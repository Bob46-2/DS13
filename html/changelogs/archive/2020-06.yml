  Nanako:
  - rscadd: Line Cutter can now be used for mining, as originally intended. It will
      cut a vast path through rock
  - bugfix: Fixed being unable to load individual line racks
  - rscdel: Planet crackers now get weaker mining cutters instead of plasma cutters.
      They can be upgraded with a workbench and powernode.
  - experiment: 'MAJOR CHANGE: Mobs are no longer considered disabled for most purposes
      if they are lying down (and still conscious, not stunned). downed mobs can hold/pickup/use
      items, and continue performing most attacks, though with penalties to accuracy
      and cooldowns.'
  - bugfix: Firearms skill now has a larger impact on gun accuracy, giving up to 15%
      bonus accuracy at the highest level. Was previously 4% due to a bug
  - tweak: Removed one case where a mob generally in pain would drop held items, it
      was redundant. Injured arms will still cause dropping of held things.
  Snypehunter007:
  - rscadd: Cargo Servicemen and the Supply Officer now have custom uniforms.
  - rscadd: The Supply Officer now has an exclusive jacket in their locker.

  - bugfix: The Wiki button at the top of the screen now sends you to the DS13 Wiki.

      this should help with refilling hallways with air significantly (assuming the
      breach is fixed).
  - bugfix: Fixed the EVA helmet's sprite from the Suit Storage Units not showing
      up.
  - maptweak: Chemistry slightly rearranged to fit the BPL.

  Nanako:
  - experiment: Fixed a major calculation bug that was causing necromorph charge attacks
      to move at roughly half of their intended speed. Some of the speeds have been
      tweaked to compensate, but overall charging necromorphs move significantly faster
      now.
  - bugfix: Fixed charge attacks being broken
  - tweak: Reduced windup time and increased flight speed on leaper leap.
  - tweak: Charge attacks with autotargeting now pick targets from a 2 tile radius
      around the clickpoint( previously 1 tile)
  - tweak: Redesigned the signal Absorb ability, now with AOE suction, neat visual
      effects, and can be used around the marker even without corruption!
  - tweak: The necromorph spawning menu is now sorted in ascending order of biomass
      cost.
  - tweak: Biomass cost of Exploder significantly increased, from 50 to 65
  - tweak: Biomass cost of Leaper slightly reduced, from 85 to 80
  - tweak: Lurker biomass cost increased from 50 to 55
  - tweak: Lurker windup and cooldown times on spine launch slightly reduced
  - tweak: Lurker spine damage slightly increased, from 13 to 14
  - tweak: Base biomass reclamation time set to 8 minutes for most necromorphs
  - tweak: Slasher biomass cost reduced from 55 to 50. It is now the cheapest of all
      necromorphs and will remain so.
  - tweak: Slasher biomass reclamation time slightly increased from 7.5 mins to 8
      mins
  - tweak: Twitcher biomass cost slightly reduced, from 130 to 120
  - bugfix: Removed ancient slasher from spawning menu. It can still spawn as a random
      variant of a slasher.
  - experiment: Humans will now block melee attacks and thrown objects, either with
      held items or their own arms. Blocking is automatic as long as you face towards
      the source of the attack, but grab/harm intent will make it more effective.
      This is a huge increase in human survivability, and several other balance changes
      have been made to offset it.
  - soundadd: Blocking attacks now has visual and audio effects.
  - experiment: Melee attacks are now guaranteed to hit, both human and necromorph.
      The new blocking system replaces evasion in melee combat. This change does not
      affect projectiles or firearms.
  - tweak: Slightly increased the damage of many necromorph attacks
  - tweak: Slightly reduced the armor values of vintage rig, security rig, and riot
      armor.
  - rscadd: Greatly buffed all forms of shields, especially riot shields. However,
      all held items - including shields - will take damage when used to block attacks,
      and eventually break.
  - experiment: Reduced the number of unitologists that will be picked at roundstart,
      and during low population times. Increased the maximum limit for high population
      times.
  - bugfix: Fixed various issues that occur when a signal or marker player disconnects
      and reconnects.
  - tweak: Significantly increased the damage dealt by thrown objects. Chucking things
      at necromorphs is a pretty valid combat style now..
  - rscadd: Added the Heavy Pulse Rifle, a powerful new weapon, currently only obtainable
      through adminspawning.
  Snypehunter007:
  - rscadd: Added defibrillators back to the clinic.
  - rscadd: Added t-comms electronics boards to electronics storage.
  - maptweak: Changed the tiles in the Bioprosthetics Lab.
2020-06-29:
  Nanako:
  - experiment: Corruption can no longer be attacked and removed with tools. To remove
      corruption, destroy the nodes spreading it instead, and it will die naturally
  - bugfix: Fixed a variety of bugs with the new melee code, involving structures
      and doors
