  Nanako:
  - bugfix: Fixed issues where cyst rotation wouldn't work in certain circumstances.
      It should now be fully reliable unless the chat entry area is focused
  - bugfix: Exploder is back and explodier than ever!
  - tweak: Object-based shooting abilities now hit a random part of the target instead
      of always the chest. This currently affects detonator, harvester, and cyst
  - bugfix: Fixed the rivet gun's fragmentate mode not working.
  - tweak: Buffed the rivet fragments' damage, from 1.8 to 2.2
  - bugfix: Fixed an error message about solnet when spawning as an observer or editing
      your character.
  - tweak: The discord button in the UI is now normally colored.
  - rscdel: Removed the Lore button from the topright. It contained bay specific stuff
      which isn't relevant for us.
  - bugfix: Fixed detonator crate being wrongly named in cargo interface.
  - tweak: Majorly increased radiation resistance on the engineering rig.  Dedicated
      radsuits are still slightly better though.
  - tweak: Generic pouches now have more reasonable storage capacity
  - tweak: Handcuffs now work on people wearing rigs. This feature was originally
      designed on baycode where rigs were a rare item
  - bugfix: Fixed sheets in storages getting stuck on screen when merging
  - tweak: Material stacks can now fit inside ordinary storage compartments.
  - tweak: Rebalanced tool degradation, power use, and failure rates, to generally
      be more forgiving. Chance of critical failures especially majorly reduced.
  - tweak: Construction skill is now factored into tool operations when crafting items.
  - tweak: Hauling skill is now factored into worktime and failure rates when digging
      out rock walls on aegis VII.
  - tweak: Brute's slam attack now deals much more damage to dense objects, especially
      walls.
  - tweak: Brute's biobomb attack is now a bit faster to fire and deals more damage.

      by traps.
  - bugfix: Fixed some cases where girders were almost impossible to break
  - tweak: Throwing items to propel yourself in space now always works
  - bugfix: Fixed issues of getting stuck when launching out of disposals
  - tweak: Tier IV Necromorphs are now spawned with total biomass instead of spending
      your storage. Total biomass includes the mass currently invested in necromorphs
      and corruption nodes, so there is no requirement to save up a lump sum.
  Terror4000rus:
  - bugfix: 'Fixed ghost''s prefix about the characters real name. So, no more things
      like ''(F)Cody Green/(Unknown(as Cody Green): Cody Green screams!'' The prefix
      will appear only if the character''s visual name is ''Unknown'' or ''Unknown
      (as not-real-name)''.'
  TheLion1675:
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue where in some instances the end of round music would suddenly
      switch track. Simplified the code it runs on, and this issue should no longer
      occur.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where Necromorphs were erroneously counted as surviving crew
      at the end of the round.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where anyone who would have escaped being marked as marooned
      on the USG Ishimura.
  - bugfix: Fixed an uncommon issue where players would be randomly teleported into
      z-levels with no movement possible at all, if they reached the edge of the level.
      i.e. Aegis VII.
  - bugfix: Fixed only suit cyclers being present in Aegis Engineering and Medical
      Post. One of them is now a cycler, the other a storage unit.
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue where alive mobs weren't counted as surviving or evacuated
      crew if the player had ghosted before the calculations occur.
  - tweak: Windows for the escape shuttles are now indestructible.
  - rscadd: Three new end-of-round statistics added as well as variations.
  - rscadd: All of the ERT shuttles are now marked post-round safezones. This adds
      onto the escape methods, if you were inclined to give that a shot.
  - rscadd: Added teleportation if anyone runs out of a shuttle while it is in transit.
      Should you do this, you will now be warped into space, and your death will be
      assured. Don't do this.
  - experiment: Rework of how escape shuttles work and act. Those who are in the pods
      now, will be able to walk around on a planetary landing site. If you're really
      lucky, it won't be infested.
  - experiemnt: Experimental fix for laptops, tablets and PDA's refusing to work after
      evacuating.
  - wip: Added in appropriate area and landmarks for the Administrative Shuttle. The
      code for this will likely be included in the same update by KMC.
2020-10-17:
  Nanako:
  - tweak: Divider puppets can no longer speak common, but will speak on the necrochat
      instead. Their body will make telltale wailing sounds when they do, so keeping
      quiet is key to going unnoticed.
  - rscadd: Added an audible new Signal Ability!
  - rscadd: Necromorphs now take 10% of incoming damage as Lasting Damage, which does
      not heal and effectively reduces their maximum health.
  - tweak: Slightly buffed the max health of divider, spitter, slasher, leaper and
      lurker, to partially compensate for the above.
  - rscadd: Added two new necromorph healing spells - one for signal, and one for
      marker. Both come with their own drawbacks, but can regrow lost limbs on live
      necromorphs.
  Snypehunter007:
  - rscadd: Given all bridge staff general belts.
  - rscadd: Added a divet to the First Lieutenant and Bridge Ensigns belts.

2020-10-20:
  TheLion1675:
  - rscadd: 'Chemical Reagent: Phlogiston, which upon mixing, unleashes a spreading
      and debilitating Phoron fire. Made with 1u Aluminum, Phoron and Sulphuric Acid,
      results in 1u.'
  - rscadd: 'Chemical Reagent: Vecuronium Bromide, one of the most powerful paralytics.
      It will reduce someone''s voice to whispers and will near-instantly paralyze
      them. Made with 1u Ethanol, and 2u of Mercury and Hydrazine. Results in 2u.'

  - tweak: Minorly lowered the amount of injected Chloral Hydrate required before
      a person is absolutely knocked out.

      than Bicaridine or Kelotane.
  - tweak: Slightly increased the metabolizing rates on Bicaridine and Kelotane.
  - tweak: Various edits to Medical vending contraband.
  - experiment: 'Experimental: Increased maximum stack amount for trauma kits and
      bruise packs by 10 each.'
  - experiment: Significantly reduced the possibility of lung rupture, puncture or
      collapse in unpressurized/inhospitable areas per tick.
  - experiment: Moderately increased growth rate of the growth tanks in the BPL.
  - rscdel: Removed the ability to swipe for nuclear codes. Why would you use this?
  - bugfix: Fixed Administrative Shuttle not having a transit place.
  - bugfix: Fixed people getting stuck on the evacuation site.
  - bugfix: Fixed people not able to get hammered on the evacuation site.
  - tweak: Altered ERT join time from 1 minute to 3 minutes.
  - maptweak: Made several, much-needed changes to the evacuation site.
