  Nanako:
  - experiment: Added our first Crew Objective, the Asteroid Defense System. Now fully
      functional, the ADS can break down, or be sabotaged. A repair mission must be
      mounted to fix it, but necromorphs will lie in wait.

  Nanako:
  - tweak: Slightly increased the cooldown times on spitter and puker ranged attacks.
  - tweak: Spitter and puker ranged attacks now have a small shared cooldown, preventing
      both shots from firing simultaneously.

  Nanako:
  - bugfix: Exploder's detonate-on-charge now works again

  - bugfix: The Asteroid Defense System airlock now works.

  Nanako:
  - rscadd: Added the Javelin Gun, a rare and powerful new weapon. It can nail victims
      to walls, and electrocute them to a crisp
  - tweak: Significantly increased the rate that ammo drops appear in random loot.
      As more weapons are added its been getting harder and harder to find ammo for
      a gun you're carrying.
  - bugfix: Fixed shotgun magazines being red
