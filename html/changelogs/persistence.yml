# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.

changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added persistent finances. Your held and stored credits will now persist between rounds. A 10% fee is applied to credits left in your account, and a 15% fee to any you're holding on death. To prevent fees, withdraw everything and stay alive for the whole round."
  - rscadd: "The items in the store are now unlocked with persistent schematics, which can be found in random loot. Uploading one unlocks a thing, and awards a bounty to the finder. Some schematics may be lost at the end of a round."
